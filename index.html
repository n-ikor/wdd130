                <p>Hello World! It's your favourite BYU-Pathway student, Nduka James Ikor. I am from
                    Nigeria and I look forward to all the possibilities that comes with this great course.
                    I enjoy watching football, reading books (non-fiction and poetry), listening to 
                    music, early morning jogging amongst other things.</p>

                <p>This image represents my state of origin, Delta State, Nigeria, a vibrant region rich in
                    cultural heritage and natural beauty. Delta is known for a lot of things, including its
                    lush landscapes, diverse ethnic groups such as the Urhobo, Isoko, Ndokwa, Itsekiri, and
                    Ijaw, and a thriving oil industry that plays a significant role in Nigeria's economy.
                    However, one standout feature is the majestic River Niger, which flows through the capital
                    city, Asaba, bringing life to the region with its scenic views and economic activities.
                    The river continues its journey southward, eventually emptying into the Gulf of Guinea,
                    shaping the state's geography and supporting its fishing and trade communities along the
                    way.</p>
